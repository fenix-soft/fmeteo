# V1.2

- fix the wind direction range bug, now the conversion rispect the data table on this picture: "wind_dir_vs_deg.png" 

# V1.0 bug note

- the wind direction range is not centered with the reference point, it results that the interval is moved 11.25 degrees clockwise and consequently the reference point is the first end of the interval and not the center.
- my homemade algorithm in some conversions is bumped at 11.25 degrees in excess

# V1.0 beta

- initial  relase. 
- homemade algorithm
